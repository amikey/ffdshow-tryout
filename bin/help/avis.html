<br/>
<br/>Not every application which can open AVI file can open Avisynth scripts, so you can use <a title="no description" href='makeAVIS.html' class='wiki'>makeAVIS</a> utility to create a &quot;fake&quot; AVI which contains only reference to Avisynth script (or the script itself). When you open this file in application, ffdshow will be used as a video or audio &quot;decompressor&quot; and will deliver frames or audio samples to that application.
<br/>
<br/>This whole idea isn't mine, it was inspired by <a class='wiki'  href='http://www.videotools.net/index.php?rub=guides&amp;htm=intro2link2.htm'>Link2</a> by Videotools.<br/></div></body></html>
