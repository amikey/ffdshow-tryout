List of known issues in revision 684:

1) Wavpack decoder only works with lossless wavpack. Lossy and hybrid wavpack
   is not yet supported.
2) Some files with interlaced H.264 video don't decode properly.
   Sample file: "http://www.egoshare.com/9dad3c13be3968c0ed977ed5cd62e25f/3rd_rock_of_sun_sampleavi.html"
   FFmpeg bug or perhaps a x264 VFW bug? (Reported by Romario)

Other bug reports:

3) Writing an OGM file via VFW interface creates a corrupt file. (reported by clsid)
4) FLV muxer seems to be buggy as well.
5) The following encoders do not work for me: MPEG 4, MPEG 1, MPEG 2, h.263, H.261
   and DV. VirtualDub 1.6.17 gives the following error: "Cannot start video
   compression. An unknown error occurred (may be corrupt data). (error code -100)".
   At least some of these encoders do work for others? Seems to depend on the input?
   Sample: "http://www.mytempdir.com/1105695" (reported by: a few people)
6) I think I have found a bug in the ffdshow subtitle filter. If I slow down the
   playback speed of the video in Media Player Classic, then the subtitles will
   continue to play at their normal speed. So the subs go faster than the video and
   synchronization is lost. After changing the playback speed back to normal, the
   subtitles will synchronize and continue at the correct position. (reported by clsid)

ToDo:

7) Add WM9 decoder passthrough
8) Update and fix SNOW support
9) Fix VMnc decoding
10) Fix VC-1 decoding
11) Update libavcodec vorbis

Other issues:

12) ICL9 builds of ffdshow.ax crash on files created by a specific old revision of
    x264 (don't know the rev number). These files should be very rare. Funny thing
    however is that the files play fine and without crash if you first play another
    file and then play the 'troublesome' file in the same player instance. Also no
    crash when using an unoptimized debug build. So this seems to be a compiler bug.
