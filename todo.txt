List of known issues in revision 1352:

1).I think I have found a bug in the ffdshow subtitle filter. If I slow down the playback speed of the video in Media Player Classic, then the subtitles will continue to play at their normal speed. So the subs go faster than the video and synchronization is lost. After changing the playback speed back to normal, the subtitles will synchronize and continue at the correct position.
2).VirtualDub crashes when it is closed if the ffdshow VFW window is still open.
3).When ffdshow is used for decoding VC-1 video or for processing Raw video after another VC-1 decoder, then framerate gets changed from 23,976 fps to 29.97 fps. Happens with .evo files. Details.
4).The audio delay filter fields in ffdshow audio decoder don't accept negative values.

Known limitations:
5).Support for SSA/ASS subtitles is incomplete.
6).7.1 audio input is not properly handled. Details. More details.

ToDo:

Update tremor. Details. 
Update swscale (?)
