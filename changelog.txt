 * 7.1ch audio processing has been added.
 * In "Crop & zoom", "Auto crop" has been added. Black borders can be removed automatically.
 * Preset auto loading: Now you can select either "On one of the conditions match (OR)" or "On all conditions match (AND)".
 * In preset auto loading, "on FOURCC from previous filter match" has been added. It is useful when ffdshow is used in RAW mode to affect a condition on the original video FOURCC.
 * For Windows Media Player 11 and Windows Media Center on Vista, a new option for RAW video processing has been added.
 * In "Resize & aspect", "Resize to screen resolution" has been added.

 * Faster RGB <-> YV12 conversion for x64.
 * Improved text subtitles and OSD rendering. Body, outline and shadow options have separately adjustable color and alpha settings. If the output color space is RGB and no other image filter (except resize) is used in the downstream, subtitles and OSD are rendered in RGB mode and the quality is improved further.
 * Multiple languages support: A horizontal scaling ratio for the config dialogs can be configured from language files. To scale them to 125% horizontally add the two lines "horizontalScale9x=125" and "horizontalScaleNT=125" in the "[Font]" section of the language file.
 * Improved German translation (making use of the extra space gained by scaling horizontally).

Changelog for Beta 3
Bugfixes
 * Black borders were not painted black in AviSynth filter and deinterlacers.
 * libavcodec encoders did not accept frame rates except 25fps. Other encoders sometimes had inaccurate frame rates.

 * A dialog is shown when an unknown application (which is neither listed in the blacklist nor in the whitelist) tries to load ffdshow.
 * libavcodec encoders pop up error messages.
 * The AviSynth filter was updated to give scripts access to more frames than just the current one. Together with the added "3:2 pulldown" settings this allows many of the IVTC, deinterlacing and temporal filters for AviSynth to work properly in ffdshow.
 * Updated icons. Classic icons are still available.
 * ATRAC3 (Adaptive TRansform Acoustic Coding, compressed audio format) has been added.
 * Xvid encoder has been multithreaded.

Changelog for Beta 2
Bugfixes
 * After changing aspect ratio, the height of the picture halved, if you used overlay mixer and YUY2. It was common on DVD playback.
 * FFV1 decoder crashed on seeks or delay.
 * FFV1 encoder: default key frame distance value was 250, which was too high and could not be configured independently. New default is 10.

 * Subtitle was gray, even if you selected white.
 * Deleting the active and default preset settings caused a crash.
 * Flipped NV12 caused either crash or corrupt image.
 * Using Media Player Classic's internal Matroska splitter, the aspect ratio was always 1.
 * When you opened audio configuration dialog during playback, the CPU usage was abnormally high and it sometimes froze especially on ADPCM audio.
 * When ffdshow connected to VobSub (VSFilter), ffdshow tried to use YV12 plus width of non-multiple of 8 and ended in crash.
 * When you configured "Resize & aspect" --> "Borders" --> "Inside" --> "100%", ffdshow ended in crash.
 * Reconnecting to VMR9 (after resizing) sometimes failed.
 * PowerDVD7 produced a black screen because of a bug in DirectShow filter's connecting code (please remove PowerDVD.exe from "DirectShow control" --> "Don't use ffdshow in:").

Changelog for Beta 1
Bugfixes
 * When you tried to re-encode using Windows Media Encoder, ffdshow audio decoder would cause WME to crash.
 * Hardware deinterlacing did not work, when using libmpeg2.
 * AAC was played back too fast so that it was not audible. A/V synch was lost.
 * When you played a video which height was an odd number, it often froze.
 * If "Mixer" --> "headphone virtual spatialization" was enabled, it crashed on playback of mono sources.
 * When you played an Xvid stream with many consecutive N-VOPs, subtitles were not shown when no new frames were actually being displayed. If there were long consecutive N-VOPs at the end of the file, it closed too early.
 * "Video decoder configuration" --> "Output" --> "DV" couldn't be unchecked.
 * If one of the files that needed updating was locked, the installer stopped with an error message.
 * Didee's YlevelsG/S/C was not implemented correctly. It was the bright parts of the pictures that saw the most effect of the gamma.
 * ffdshow could not connect to uncompressed audio input.
 * LPCM output was broken.
 * AC3 output was broken.
 * DTS was broken with large noise.
 * Perspective correction with cubic interpolation crashed if the width of the video was over 768.
 * 5.1ch Vorbis (libavcodec) was broken.
 * When you tried to use ffdshow DirectShow decoder in PowerDVD, the video was black.
 * If ffdshow got DVD decoder's output input as RAW video, the subtitle file was valid and MPEG2 was disabled, subtitles that were not related to the DVD were shown.
 * If subtitles including video image such as IDX+SUB (VobSub) format were enabled, it crashed where the height of the subtitles was an odd number.
 * Convolver, one of the audio filters, crashed when you tried to load impulse file.
 * When you used resize, horizontal lines were sometimes seen ("Resize" --> "Settings" --> "Accurate rounding").
 * If you used resize after xsharpen, the video was green.

 * The dialog was garbled, if "Tray, dialog & paths" --> "Japanese (Unicode)" was selected (ANSI builds). The problem was that the installer set it by default for Japanese version of Windows.
 * ANSI/MBCS was not processed properly. For example, OSD item "Source file" couldn't show last few characters if MBCS was used in the path. It was a security concern.
 * If you used translation of the dialog, content of the dialog was scaled about 130% but the size of the window was not. As a result, you couldn't see the right, hidden part of the dialog (depending on the way to launch the dialog).
