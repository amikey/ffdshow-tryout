Resize algorithms:
  Fast bilinear - fast with acceptable quality
  Bilinear - quality slighty better than previous, but a little bit slower
  Bicubic - high quality, slower
  Point - fastest, ugliest
  Area - area averaging scaling
  Bicublin - luminance bicubic, chroma bilinear
  None - just adds black borders or crops the image
Gaussian blur - during resizing, image can be slightly blurred - independend on blur filter
Sharpen - sharpens image during resizing, independend on sharpening filters

Interlaced:
  unchecked - frames are treated as progressive
  checked - frames are treated as interlaced
  grayed - decide by input frame type (use when processing MPEG2 video)

Accurate rounding:
  unchecked - sometimes horizontal lines are seen
  checked - high quality, slower in some cases
