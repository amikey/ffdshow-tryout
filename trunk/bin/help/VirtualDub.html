<br/><div class="simplebox">VirtualDub is a video capture/processing utility for 32-bit Windows platforms (95/98/ME/NT4/2000/XP), licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).  It lacks the editing power of a general-purpose editor such as Adobe Premiere, but is streamlined for fast linear operations over video.  It has batch-processing capabilities for processing large numbers of files and can be extended with third-party video filters.  <a title="no description" href="VirtualDub.html" class="wiki">VirtualDub</a> is mainly geared toward processing AVI files, although it can read (not write) MPEG-1 and also handle sets of BMP images.</div>

<br/>Many image processing filters found in ffdshow were inspired by (and sometimes directly copied from) either <a title="no description" href="VirtualDub.html" class="wiki">VirtualDub</a> itself of from its filters.<br/></div></body></html>
