Since ffdshow itself isn't and application it uses DirectInput<a href='' class='wiki'>?</a> for detecting keyboard events. These events can be processed even if application using ffdshow doesn't have keyboard focus. This is controlled by <b>Process keypresses even if not fucused</b> checkbox. It is off by default. Informations about keyboard events can be displayed in the playback window using OSD<a href='' class='wiki'>?</a> feature.
<br/>
<br/>Currently few features are available for keyboard control and more may be added in the future. Generally it is enabling/disabling of particular image filters, seeking and subtitles control. Seek distance can be customized using <b>Seek distance in secs</b> edit boxes.
<br/>
<br/>Default keyboard shortcuts are predefined, but it's possible to customize them either by double clicking on keyboard action (key name will change to <b>press key</b>) and pressing desired key. Pressing the <b>Esc</b> key while in &quot;press key&quot; mode will cancel the key setting operation. Other way to change key for an action is by selecting an item in the list and presing <b>space</b>. <b>Press key</b> will appear similarly as for double click. When not in key changing mode, pressing the <b>delete</b> key will remove key assignment for selected action.
<br/>
<br/><b>Activation key 1</b> and <b>Activation key 2</b> and key defined for desired action must be pressed simultaneously for action to be performed. By default activation keys are <b>ctrl</b> and <b>alt</b>, but it might be needed to change them to not conflict with player application own keyboard shortcuts.
<br/>
<br/>Some actions can perform different tasks if <b>Second function</b> key is pressed:
<br/><ul><li>forward/backward seeks by <b>Seek distance with modifier</b> seconds
</li><li>OSD cycles through OSD presets
</li><li>subtitles delay/size changes size
</li><li>subtitles position moves vertically</li></ul></div></body></html>
