<br/>
<br/><div class="simplebox">Basically, <a title="no description" href="AviSynth.html" class="wiki">AviSynth</a> works like this: First, you create a simple text document with special commands, called a script. These commands make references to one or more videos and the filters you wish to run on them. Then, you run a video application, such as VirtualDub<a href='' class='wiki'>?</a>, and open the script file. This is when <a title="no description" href="AviSynth.html" class="wiki">AviSynth</a> takes action. It opens the videos you referenced in the script, runs the specified filters, and feeds the output to video application. The application, however, is not aware that <a title="no description" href="AviSynth.html" class="wiki">AviSynth</a> is working in the background. Instead, the application thinks that it is directly opening a filtered AVI file that resides on your hard drive.</div>
<br/>
<br/>ffdshow uses Avisynth precise colorspace conversion routines and few image processing filters. Additionally it is possible to write simple Avisynth scripts directly inside ffdshow.
<br/>
<br/>ffdshow distribution contains makeAVIS<a href='' class='wiki'>?</a> utility to produce &quot;fake&quot; AVI files from Avisynth scripts to use them in application which don't support avs files directly.<br/></div></body></html>
