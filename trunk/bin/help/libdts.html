It is released under the terms of the GPL license. The DTS Coherent Acoustics standard is used in a variety of applications, including DVD, DTS audio CD and radio broadcasting.
<br/>
<br/>The main goals in libdts development are:
<br/>
<br/><ul><li>Portability - currently all of the code is written in C, and when we write platform-specific optimizations we will always keep a generic C routine to fall back on.
</li><li>Reuseability - we do not want libdts to include any project-specific code, but it should still include enough features to be used by very diverse projects.
</li><li>Precision - we do not yet fully support all the core specification of the DTS Coherent Acoustics standard so do not expect too much of this library for now.
</li><li>Speed - current code is not optimised at all.
</li></ul>
