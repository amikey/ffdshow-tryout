List of known issues in revision 755:

1) Wavpack decoder only works with lossless wavpack. Lossy and hybrid wavpack is not
   yet supported.
2) Some files with interlaced H.264 video don't decode properly. 
   (Sample: http://www.egoshare.com/9dad3c13be3968c0ed977ed5cd62e25f/3rd_rock_of_sun_sampleavi.html)
   FFmpeg bug or perhaps a x264 VFW bug? (Reported by Romario)
3) Encoding fails if threads > 1 for the following formats: DivX 3, MS MPEG-4 V2,
   H.263(+), WMV7, WMV8, MJPEG, DV and FLV1. Please test this fix
   (http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?p=924629#post924629).

Other bug reports:

4) The following encoders do not work for me: MPEG 1, MPEG 2 and DV (does DV have
   input limitations like H263?). VirtualDub 1.6.17 gives the following error:
   "Cannot start video compression. An unknown error occurred (may be corrupt data).
   (error code -100)". (reported by: clsid)
5) I think I have found a bug in the ffdshow subtitle filter. If I slow down the
   playback speed of the video in Media Player Classic, then the subtitles will
   continue to play at their normal speed. So the subs go faster than the video and
   synchronization is lost. After changing the playback speed back to normal, the
   subtitles will synchronize and continue at the correct position. (reported by clsid)
6) There is an abnormal increase in CPU usage when the ffdshow audio panel is open
   during playback. (reported by foxyshadis)
7) Queue is off in Overlay Mixer. (reported by clsid)
8) ffdshow raw filter doesn't work in ZoomPlayer. (reported by midiboy)

ToDo:

9) Update SNOW
10) Fix VMnc decoding
11) Fix libavcodec VC-1 decoding
12) H.261 and H.263 encoders only support specific resolutions. An error message
    should be added and shown when an unsupported input resolution is used. H.261
    supports 176x144 and 352x288. H.263 supports 128x96, 176x144, 352x288, 704x576 and
    1408x1152.

Other issues:

13) ICL9 builds of ffdshow.ax crash on files created by a specific old revision of
    x264 (don't know the rev number). These files should be very rare. Funny thing
    however is that the files play fine and without crash if you first play another
    file and then play the 'troublesome' file in the same player instance. Also no
    crash when using an unoptimized debug build. So this seems to be a compiler bug.
    (Sample: http://rapidshare.com/files/1609924/sample.mp4.html). (reported by clsid)
