   2. FLV4 decoding crashes for this sample file.
   3. B-frame decoding delay in VFW when using libavcodec for Xvid/DivX. Details.
   4. In some cases VobSub subtitle files (.idx/.sub) are loaded, but no subs are displayed. VobSub support is still incomplete.

   6. Some issues with logoaway in combination with image mask filter. Details.


Short term ToDo list:

   1. Update libswscale and mp3lib.
   2. Fix compilation of libmplayer to 64bit target using GCC.
   3. Fix compilation of kerneldeint to 64bit target using GCC.
   4. Don't display a .sub file in "subtitle sources" list when a .idx with same name also exists.


Mid term ToDo list:
