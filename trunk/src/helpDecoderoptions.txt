IDCT 
If you see periodically appearing faint horizontal lines in the movie or colors are slightly changing, try to select different IDCT routine
Following descriptions are based only on some users experiences, you may obtain different results.
Simple 16383 - this is preferred routine, it's fast and quite accurate, but may produce some artifacts with DIVX 4,5 and XVID movies
Normal - slightly slower than above and may produce horizontal stripes with DIVX 3
Reference - most precise, but very slow - it is usable only for testing
Simple 16384  - older version of Simple 16383, it's deprecated now
XviD - IDCT routine from XviD decoder, good for DIVX 4, DIVX 5 and XVID movies
