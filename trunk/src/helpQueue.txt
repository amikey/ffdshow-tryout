Queue output samples
 The objective of the queue is to reduce frame drops.
 It is effective when CPU load is high and dropping a few frames/sec.
 It deposits the time when CPU has finished work early and  use the time
 when delayed.
 Because video renderer is executed on another thead, the effect is
 greater if you have Pentium4HT or dual core CPU.

 Use queue only in:
  Queue is disabled by default because of stability problem.
  If you dare try it, uncheck or add the execute file name of the video
  applications, separated by semicolons.

Other controls
 video delay:
  If your speaker is far from listening point, you may want to try this.
