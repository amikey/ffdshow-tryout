  <p class="small_caption">
    Fixed after beta2
  </p>

  <ul class="fixed">
    <li>libavcodec encoders did not accept frame rates except 25fps. Other encoders sometimes had inaccurate frame rates.</li>
    <li>If ffdshowaudio() was used in AviSynth script, an error occurred.</li>
    <li>If a Unicode subtitle file contained 0x1a, the rendering failed.</li>
    <li>The image got mirrored if AviSynth filter output in RGB color space.</li>
    <li>If "RAW video" -> "YV12" in VFW decoder was enabled, the image got mirrored when VFW codec was used via DirectShow.</li>
    <li>Improved stability of Winamp plugin handling.</li>
    <li>On the fly resize: If you entered 8 (as the first digit of 800) for the vertical size, it crashed depending on the used method (lanczos tap>=4, spline, etc).</li>
    <li>If resize was being used, changes to the pixel aspect ratio (SAR) of the video were ignored.</li>
    <li>If "Resize &amp; aspect" -> "Borders" -> "Inside" was used, "Keep original aspect ratio" calculated wrong size.</li>
    <li>AviSynth script could not be saved (Unicode builds only).</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="small_caption">
    Fixed before beta2
  </p>

  <ul class="fixed">
    <li>After changing aspect ratio, the height of the picture halved, if you used overlay mixer and YUY2. It was common on DVD playback.</li>
    <li>FFV1 decoder crashed on seeks or delay.</li>
    <li>FFV1 encoder: default key frame distance value was 250, which was too high and could not be configured independently. New default is 10.</li>
    <li>When NV12 was the only available output color space for DirectShow decoder and "Raw video" was enabled for VfW decoder, Windows Media Player 11 thumbnailer crashed.</li>
    <li>Subtitle was gray, even if you selected white.</li>
    <li>Deleting the active and default preset settings caused a crash.</li>
    <li>Flipped NV12 caused either crash or corrupt image.</li>
    <li>Using Media Player Classic's internal Matroska splitter, the aspect ratio was always 1.</li>
    <li>When you opened audio configuration dialog during playback, the CPU usage was abnormally high and it sometimes freezed especially on ADPCM audio.</li>
    <li>When ffdshow connected to VobSub (VSFilter), ffdshow tried to use YV12 plus width of non-multiple of 8 and ended in crash.</li>
    <li>When you configured "Resize &amp; aspect" -> "Borders" -> "Inside" -> "100%", ffdshow ended in crash.</li>
    <li>Reconnecting to VMR9 (after resizing) sometimes failed.</li>
    <li>PowerDVD7 produced a black screen because of a bug in DirectShow filter's connecting code (please remove PowerDVD.exe from "Info &amp; debug" -> "Don't use ffdshow in:").</li>
    <li>If a subtitle unit contained too many lines for the specified space, lines were being dropped.</li>
    <li>The right edges of italic subtitles were cut off. If "fast rendering" was enabled, italic text was sometimes shown as non-italic and vice versa.</li>
    <li>Some SVQ3 videos caused freeze.</li>
    <li>Changing Matroska subtitles track ended in a crash.</li>
    <li>Multibyte characters in Matroska-embedded subtitles were garbled.</li>
    <li>If noise and resize filters were applied, chroma became green.</li>
    <li>Explorer.exe crashed on Windows Vista when accessing a folder that contains AVI files.</li>
    <li>Playing or seeking in MPEG1/2 videos using libmpeg2, sometimes produced ugly green artifacts or ended with a crash (libmpeg2).</li>
    <li>Fixed OGG &amp; OGM muxers. Removed FLV &amp; MPEG muxers.</li>
    <li>When you played a video which height was not a multiple of four, it crashed or artifacts were seen depending on the output color space.</li>
    <li>When you played a video which width was over 1024, it crashed when using RGB to YUY2 conversion.</li>
    <li>When you played a video which height was an odd number and YV12 was enabled, the video became distorted.</li>
    <li>If ffdshow was connected to Haali's video renderer, seeking sometimes failed.</li>
    <li>The next internal filter of Kernel deinterlace was skipped on every other frame. If the next internal filter was "Resize", the video size changed on every frame.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="small_caption">
    Fixed before beta1
  </p>

  <ul class="fixed">
    <li>When you tried to re-encode using Windows Media Encoder, ffdshow audio decoder would cause WME to crash.</li>
    <li>Hardware deinterlacing did not work, when using libmpeg2.</li>
    <li>AAC was played back too fast so that it was not audible. A/V synch was lost.</li>
    <li>When you played a video which height was an odd number, it often freezed.</li>
    <li>If "Mixer" -> "headphone virtual spatialization" was enabled, it crashed on playback of mono sources.</li>
    <li>When you played an Xvid stream with many consecutive N-VOPs, subtitles were not shown when no new frames were actually being displayed. If there were long consecutive N-VOPs at the end of the file, it closed too early.</li>
    <li>"Video decoder configuration" -> "Output" -> "DV" couldn't be unchecked.</li>
    <li>If one of the files that needed updating was locked, the installer stopped with an error message.</li>
    <li>Didee's YlevelsG/S/C was not implemented correctly. It was the bright parts of the pictures that saw the most effect of the gamma.</li>
    <li>ffdshow could not connect to uncompressed audio input.</li>
    <li>LPCM output was broken.</li>
    <li>AC3 output was broken.</li>
    <li>DTS was broken with large noise.</li>
    <li>Perspective correction with cubic interpolation crashed if the width of the video was over 768.</li>
    <li>5.1ch Vorbis (libavcodec) was broken.</li>
    <li>When you tried to use ffdshow DirectShow decoder in PowerDVD, the video was black.</li>
    <li>If ffdshow got DVD decoder's output input as RAW video, the subtitle file was valid and MPEG2 was disabled, subtitles that were not related to the DVD were shown.</li>
    <li>If subtitles including video image such as IDX+SUB (VOBsub) format were enabled, it crashed where the height of the subtitles was an odd number.</li>
    <li>Convolver, one of the audio filters, crashed when you tried to load impulse file.</li>
    <li>When you used resize, horizontal lines were sometimes seen ("Resize" -> "Settings" -> "Accurate rounding").</li>
    <li>If you used resize after xsharpen, the video was green.</li>
    <li>Stereoscopic subtitle crashed.</li>
    <li>OSD item "CPU Load" did not show correct value in multiprocessor system.</li>
    <li>Postprocessing automatic quality control did not work in multiprocessor systems.</li>
    <li>Volume normalization did not work properly.</li>
    <li>DScaler: Video (TomsMoComp) crashed depending on the compiler used for building.</li>
    <li>Overlay control could not load initial value properly.</li>
    <li>Oblivion and Morrowind (both are games) crashed.</li>
    <li>On Windows Vista, codec configuration dialog was broken.</li>
    <li>If there was an error in AviSynth script in ffdshow, the error message was displayed on top of video. The error message still remained after the whole AviSynth page was unchecked.</li>
    <li>The dialog was garbled, if "Tray, dialog &amp; paths" -> "Japanese (Unicode)" was selected (ANSI builds). The problem was that the installer set it by default for Japanese version of Windows.</li>
    <li>ANSI/MBCS was not processed properly. For example, OSD item "Source file" couldn't show last few characters if MBCS was used in the path. It was a security concern.</li>
    <li>If you used translation of the dialog, content of the dialog was scaled about 130% but the size of the window was not. As a result, you couldn't see the right, hidden part of the dialog (depending on the way to launch the dialog).</li>
    <li>Subtitles were garbled if "Subtitles" -> "Font" -> "Fast rendering" was enabled and you used MBCS on ANSI builds.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="medium_caption">
    <a name="features" id="features">New features</a>
  </p>

  <p class="small_caption">
    Added after beta2
  </p>

  <ul class="added">
    <li>Deinterlacing support (set interlace flag) for Xvid (Xvidcore) decoders.</li>
    <li>A dialog has been added to show a message when an unknown application (that is not listed in the whitelist) tries to load ffdshow.</li>
    <li>libavcodec encoders pop up error messages.</li>
    <li>The AviSynth filter was updated to give scripts access to more frames than just the current one. Together with the added "3:2 pulldown" settings this allows many of the IVTC, deinterlacing and temporal filters for AviSynth to work properly in ffdshow.</li>
    <li>Updated icons ( <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="../images/modern_icon_xp.png" width="60" height="23" title="New ffdshow icons" alt="New ffdshow icons" /> ). Classic icons are still available.</li>
    <li>ATRAC3 (Adaptive TRansform Acoustic Coding, compressed audio format) has been added.</li>
    <li>Xvid encoder has been multithreaded.</li>
    <li>Support for SPDIF on Windows Vista has been added ("Audio decoder configuration" -> "Output" -> "Connect to:").</li>
    <li>Multichannel audio processing by Winamp plugins has been added.</li>
    <li>In "Resize &amp; aspect" dialog, a new check box "Process pixel aspect ratio internally" has been added.</li>
    <li>Resize GUI: "Specify horizontal size" instead of "Specify vertical size 0 for auto".</li>
    <li>Audio decoder AC3 output: the new check box "Encode only multichannel streams" allows sending multichannel audio (which otherwise cannot be digitally sent) to AV-amp in AC3-SPDIF.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="small_caption">
    Added before beta2
  </p>

  <ul class="added">
    <li>Improved subtitle shadow. 3 shadow modes are available: classic, glowing and gradient.</li>
    <li>Management of compatibility issues: "Use ffdshow only in:" option ensures that ffdshow only runs in supported applications.</li>
    <li>Hardware deinterlacing support for RAW video (interlacing-related information which was input as RAW video is being sent to downstream filters).</li>
    <li>New OSD item "IDCT(libavcodec)" displays which IDCT method is used.</li>
    <li>In "Subtitles" -> "Search in", extensions priority can be specified.</li>
    <li>VC-1 Advanced Profile support (libavcodec can work without external codecs).</li>
    <li>Various WMV and VC-1 content can be played using Microsoft's codec (VC-1 needs external codec or WMP11 installed).</li>
    <li>x264 encoder re-added and updated.</li>
    <li>Deinterlacing support (set interlace flag) for H.264 MBAFF.</li>
    <li>Corrections and new features of the Remote API: presets, subtitles, fast forward/backward etc.</li>
    <li>Polish Inno Setup translation</li>
    <li>Queue: ffdshow now uses VMR9's internal queue.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="small_caption">
    Added before beta1
  </p>

  <ul class="added">
    <li>H.264 MBAFF (interlaced format) support.</li>
    <li>VP6, WavPack (lossless) and several other codecs have been added.</li>
    <li>VC-1 Advanced Profile support for wmv9lib. You need WMP11 or Microsoft's VC-1 codec.</li>
    <li>The installer can set speaker configuration. It loads the setting of the OS (control panel) as default.</li>
    <li>Queue: Accelerator. It deposits the time when CPU has finished work early and uses the time when delayed.</li>
    <li>Multithreaded resize: Faster resize on multi-core CPUs.</li>
    <li>Calculates the vertical size automatically when you enter 0 for vertical size ("Resize" -> "Specify size" -> "New size").</li>
    <li>Vorbis: High accuracy mode is enabled for tremor.</li>
    <li>Quality control is now configurable ("Decoder options" -> "Quality control").</li>
    <li>Show error message if the splitter failed to provide necessary information to decode SVQ3.</li>
