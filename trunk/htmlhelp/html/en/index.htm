  <p>
    <span class="small_caption">Fixed after beta1</span>
  </p>

  <ul class="fixed">
    <li>Explorer.exe crashed on Windows Vista when accessing a folder that contains AVI files.</li>
    <li>Playing or seeking in MPEG1/2 videos using libmpeg2, sometimes produced ugly green artifacts or ended with a crash (libmpeg2).</li>
    <li>Fixed OGG &amp; OGM muxers. Removed FLV &amp; MPEG muxers.</li>
    <li>When you played a video which height was not a multiple of four, it crashed or artifacts were seen depending on the output color space.</li>
    <li>When you played a video which width was over 1024, it crashed when using RGB to YUY2 conversion.</li>
    <li>When you played a video which height was an odd number and YV12 was enabled, the video became distorted.</li>
    <li>If ffdshow was connected to Haali's video renderer, seeking sometimes failed.</li>
    <li>The next internal filter of Kernel deinterlace was skipped on every other frame. If the next internal filter was 'resize', the video size changed on every frame.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <span class="small_caption">Fixed before beta1</span>
  </p>

  <ul class="fixed">
    <li>When you tried to re-encode using Windows Media Encoder, ffdshow audio decoder would cause WME to crash.</li>
    <li>Hardware deinterlacing did not work, when using libmpeg2.</li>
    <li>AAC was played back too fast that it was not audible. A/V synch was lost.</li>
    <li>When you played a video which height was an odd number, it often freezed.</li>
    <li>If Mixer-headphone virtual spatialization was enabled, it crashed on playback of mono sources.</li>
    <li>When you played an Xvid stream with many consecutive N-VOPs, subtitles were not shown when no new frames were actually being displayed. If there were long consecutive N-VOPs at the end of the file, it closed too early.</li>
    <li>'Video decoder configuration'-'Output'-'DV' couldn't be unchecked.</li>
    <li>If one of the files that needed updating was locked, the installer stopped with an error message.</li>
    <li>Didee's YlevelsG/S/C was not implemented correctly. It was the bright parts of the pictures that saw the most effect of the gamma.</li>
    <li>ffdshow could not connect to Uncompressed audio input.</li>
    <li>LPCM output was broken.</li>
    <li>AC3 output was broken.</li>
    <li>DTS was broken with large noise.</li>
    <li>Perspective correction with cubic interpolation crashed if the width of the video was over 768.</li>
    <li>5.1ch Vorbis (libavcodec) was broken.</li>
    <li>When you tried to use ffdshow directshow decoder in PowerDVD, the video was black.</li>
    <li>If ffdshow was inputing DVD decoder's output as raw video, and if subtitle-file was valid and MPEG2 was disabled, subtitles that were not related to the DVD were shown.</li>
    <li>If subtitles including video image such as IDX+SUB (vobsub) format were enabled, it crashed where the height of the subtitles was an odd number.</li>
    <li>Convolver, one of the audio filters, crashed when you tried to load impulse file.</li>
    <li>When you used resize, horizontal lines were sometimes seen ('Resize'-'Settings'-'Accurate rounding').</li>
    <li>If you used resize after xsharpen, the video was green.</li>
    <li>Stereoscopic subtitle crashed.</li>
    <li>OSD 'CPU Load' did not show correct value in multiprocessor system.</li>
    <li>Postprocessing automatic quality control did not work in multiprocessor systems.</li>
    <li>Volume normalization did not work properly.</li>
    <li>DScaler: Video (TomsMoComp) crashed depending on the compiler used for building.</li>
    <li>Overlay control could not load initial value properly.</li>
    <li>Oblivion, Morrowind (both are games) crashed.</li>
    <li>On Windows Vista, codec configuration dialog was broken.</li>
    <li>If there's an error in avisynth script in ffdshow, the error message was displayed on top of video. The error message still remains after the whole avisynth page was unchecked.</li>
    <li>The dialog was garbled, if Japanese (UNICODE) was selected for "Tray, dialog &amp; paths" setting (ANSI builds). The problem was that the installer set it by default for Japanese version of Windows.</li>
    <li>ANSI/MBCS was not processed properly. For example, OSD 'Source file' couldn't show last few characters if MBCS was used in the path. It was a security concern.</li>
    <li>If you used translation of the dialog, content of the dialog was scaled about 130% but the size of the window was not. As a result, you couldn't see the right, hidden part of the dialog (depending on the way to launch the dialog).</li>
    <li>Subtitles were garbled if 'Subtitles'-'Font'-'Fast rendering' was enabled, if you used MBCS on ANSI builds.</li>
  </ul>
