    <H2>Changelog</H2>
    <H3>Bug fixes</H3>
    This list is based on the latest revision of the original project except the mt patch.<BR>
    Bugs that have been added and fixed in the tryouts are not included.    
    <H4>Fixed after beta1</H4>
    <OL>
        <LI>Explorer.exe crashed on Windows Vista when you accessed a folder that contains AVI files.
        <LI>When you started playing or seeking MPEG1/2 movies using libmpeg2, it sometimes crashed or produced ugly green artifacts (libmpeg2).
        <LI>Fixed ogg & ogm muxers. Removed flv & mpeg muxers.
        <LI>When you played a video which height was not a multiple of four, it crashed or artifacts were seen depending on the output color space.
        <LI>When you played a video which width was over 1024, it crashed when using RGB to YUY2 conversion.
        <LI>When you played a video which height was an odd number and YV12 was enabled, the video was distorted.
        <LI>If ffdshow was connected to Haali's video renderer, seeking sometimes failed.
        <LI>The next internal filter of Kernel deinterlace was skipped on every other frame. If the next internal filter was resize, the video size changed on every frame.
    </OL>
    <H4>Fixed before beta1</H4>
    <OL Start=9>
        <LI>When you tried to re-encode using Windows Media Encoder, ffdshow audio decoder would cause WME to crash.
        <LI>Hardware deinterlacing did not work, when you used libmpeg2.
        <LI>AAC was played back too fast that it was not audible. Audio-video synch was lost.
        <LI>When you played a video which height was an odd number, it often freezed.
        <LI>If Mixer-headphone virtual spatialization was enabled, it crashed on playback of mono sources.
        <LI>When you played an Xvid stream with many consecutive N-VOPs, subtitles were not shown when no new frames were actually being displayed. If there were long consecutive N-VOPs at the end of the file, it closed too early.
        <LI>'Video decoder configuration'-'Output'-'DV' couldn't be unchecked.
        <LI>If one of the files that needed updating was locked, the installer stopped with an error message.
        <LI>Didee's YlevelsG/S/C was not implemented correctly. It was the bright parts of the pictures that saw the most effect of the gamma.
        <LI>ffdshow could not connect to Uncompressed audio input.
        <LI>LPCM output was broken.
        <LI>AC3 output was broken.
        <LI>DTS was broken with large noise.
        <LI>Perspective correction with cubic interpolation crashed if the width of the video was over 768.
        <LI>5.1ch Vorbis (libavcodec) was broken.
        <LI>When you tried to use ffdshow directshow decoder in PowerDVD, the video was black.
        <LI>If ffdshow was inputing DVD decoder's output as raw video, and if subtitle-file was valid and mpeg2 was disabled, subtitles that were not related to the DVD were shown.
        <LI>If subtitles including video image such as IDX+SUB (vobsub) format were enabled, it crashed where the height of the subtitles was an odd number.
        <LI>Convolver, one of the audio filters, crashed when you tried to load impulse file.
        <LI>When you used resize, horizontal lines were sometimes seen ('Resize'-'Settings'-'Accurate rounding').
        <LI>If you used resize after xsharpen, the video was green.
        <LI>Stereoscopic subtitle crashed.
        <LI>OSD 'CPU Load' did not show correct value in multiprocessor system.
        <LI>Postprocessing automatic quality control did not work in multiprocessor systems.
        <LI>Volume normalization did not work properly.
        <LI>DScaler: Video (TomsMoComp) crashed depending on the compiler used for building.
        <LI>Overlay control could not load initial value properly.
        <LI>Oblivion, Morrowind (both are games) crashed.
        <LI>On Windows Vista, codec configuration dialog was broken.
        <LI>If there's an error in avisynth script in ffdshow, the error message was displayed on top of video. The error message still remains after the whole avisynth page was unchecked.
        <LI>The dialog was garbled, if Japanese (UNICODE) was selected for "Tray, dialog & paths" setting (ANSI builds). The problem was that the installer set it by default for Japanese version of Windows.
        <LI>ANSI/MBCS was not processed properly. For example, OSD 'Source file' couldn't show last few characters if MBCS was used in the path. It was a security concern.
        <LI>If you used translation of the dialog, content of the dialog was scaled about 130% but the size of the window was not. As a result, you couldn't see the right, hidden part of the dialog (depending on the way to launch the dialog).
        <LI>Subtitles were garbled if 'Subtitles'-'Font'-'Fast rendering' was enabled, if you used MBCS on ANSI builds.
    </OL>

    <H3>New features</H3>
    <H4>Added after beta1</H4>
    <OL>

    </OL>
    <H4>Added before beta1</H4>

        <LI>H.264 MBAFF (interlaced format) support.
        <LI>VP6, RV10/20, Wavpack (lossless) and several codecs have been added.
        <LI>VC-1 Advanced Profile support for wmv9lib. You need WMP11 or Microsoft's VC-1 codec.
        <LI>The installer can set speaker configuration. It loads the setting of the OS (control panel) as default.
        <LI>Queue: Accelerator. It deposits the time when CPU has finished work early and uses the time when delayed.
        <LI>Multithreaded resize: Faster resize on dual-core CPU.
        <LI>Calculate the vertical size automatically when you enter 0 for vertical size ('Resize'-'Specify size'-'New size').
